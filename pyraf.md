# PyRAF

PyRAF is a command language for IRAF based on the Python scripting language
that can be used in place of the existing IRAF CL. It allows such things as
importing Python modules, starting in any directory, GUI parameter editing and
help. It can be importedinto Python allowing you to run IRAF commands from
within a larger script.

PyRAF was developed since 1999 at the Space Telescope Science Institute
(STScI). Development and Support were stopped in 2019. Further maintainance
will be in the framework of the IRAF Community.
