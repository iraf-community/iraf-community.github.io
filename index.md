IRAF is the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, a general purpose
software system for the reduction and analysis of astronomical
data. IRAF is licensed under a [MIT style license](COPYRIGHT). The
software was written by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories
(NOAO) in Tucson, Arizona. However, development and maintenance of
IRAF is discontinued since 2013. The latest NOAO release had a large
number of problems, including major license issues and security bugs.

To prevent the software from bitrotting, and to fix bugs that are in
the package despite (or because) of its age, the
[iraf-community](https://github.com/iraf-community/) works on
maintaining IRAF and integrating the available patches into the source
code.

## Warning

Please be aware the IRAF is 35 years old legacy code and institutional
support for IRAF and its usage is going away quickly. It is
recommended to search alternative solutions, for example in the
[Astropy](https://astropy.org) community, and not to start new
projects using IRAF. See [this
article](http://www.stsci.edu/news/newsletters/pagecontent/institute-newsletters/2018-volume-35-issue-03/removing-the-institutes-dependence-on-iraf-you-can-do-it-too)
in the STScI newsletter for rationale and recommendations.

## Contributing Code, Documentation, or Feedback

IRAF can only survive by the contribution of its users, so we welcome
and encourage your contributions. The preferred way to report a bug is
to create a new issue on the
[IRAF GitHub issue](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/issues) page.
To contribute patches, we suggest to create a
[pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pulls).
Another way to contribute is to package IRAF for your favourite operating
system and distribution.
