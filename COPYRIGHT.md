Copyright information of source code that is included in IRAF can be
found in the subdirectory
[`doc/LICENSES`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/tree/main/doc/LICENSES)
of the IRAF source code.

The last NOAO versions of IRAF had licensing problems with non-free
code from the book [*Numerical Recipes*](http://numerical.recipes/)
and not acknowledging contributions from the [IRAF64
project](https://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~cyamauch/iraf64/index.html). These
problems are described in detail
[here](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/license-problems). They
are all resolved in the community distribution of IRAF.
