# The repository iraf/iraf-v216
iraf/iraf-v216 was a Github repository published by the
[@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) user between April 2017 and
October 2018.  The repository contained the slightly updated sources
from the version 2.16.1, and is still available as the [`iraf-v216`
branch in the iraf-community
repository](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/tree/iraf-v216). Several
issues and pull requests were created during that time, but never
merged into the iraf-v216 repository.

In April 2018 the Github repository was set readonly, so that no more
issues and pull requests could be opened or handled otherwise. In
October 2018, the iraf-v216 repository was removed. The iraf-community
web site keeps a readonly backup of the [issues](issues/) and [pull
requests](issues/pulls) for reference, and the [iraf-community Github
repository](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf) is built on top of
the iraf/iraf-v216 repository. Most of the pull requests are merged
into the iraf-community repository. See the [Release notes](https://iraf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases/v217revs.html)
for a complete list.
