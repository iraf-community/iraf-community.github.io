## Numerical Recipes

Up to version 2.16.1 (released 2013), IRAF contains a number of routines adopted from the book "Numerical Recipes in Fortran". The [FAQ of the NR book](http://www.nr.com/licenses/redistribute.html) about licensing says:
>*  [...] Can you include Numerical Recipes routines as part of that source code, including a notice that they are only allowed to be used with your application?
>      -  Sorry, no. We never give permission for Numerical Recipes source code to be posted on any public server, or distributed with any freeware or shareware package [...]
>* You want to translate some (or all) the Numerical Recipes routines to a different computer language, and then redistribute the resulting translations.
>     -  [...] However, you can't redistribute the translations in any manner, since they are "derivative works" and still subject to our copyright.

It [seems](https://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=4&showtopic=1468264) that IRAF was allowed to "use" this code as long as the following lines are included:
```
# Based on Numerical Recipes by Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling.
# Used by permission of the authors.
# Copyright(c) 1986 Numerical Recipes Software.
```

This looks however questionable here: First it says "used" and not "distribute" or "modify", which makes these files unsuitable for an Open Source project. It is also impossible to link these files with [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html) code (like `math/slalib/`) and redistribute the binaries, as it is done in the binary distributions of IRAF 2.16.1.

[README](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/tree/3eea23e7ece09523d3770ab6b227be69d8924947/unix/os/net):

> NOTE -- This directory contains software which is adapted from the
