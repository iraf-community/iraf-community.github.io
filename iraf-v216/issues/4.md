Here are the last few lines from make if this helps anyone working with linux64 ([@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele), [@joequant](https://github.com/joequant), [@pkgw](https://github.com/pkgw), [@sergiuspro](https://github.com/sergiuspro) [@fedya](https://github.com/fedya) [@jehturner](https://github.com/jehturner) (or any others)

I noticed that the mkpkg in vendor/readline doesn't have a if branch for 'linux64'. I'm wondering if anyone knows for sure if it should?

Try looking at my build script.  
  
IRAF involves building a series of compilers that build other compilers, so if there is an error, it usually meant that something earlier in the compile failed.  
  
One other build hint is that because IRAF uses a lot of symbolic links, you might have a build work and then stop working because of a symlink thats there.  I've found it necessary to clean out the tree before starting a build.

Another problem that I ran into three years ago is that even if you get a compile, it took me a few weeks to get a system to run without crashing.  The reason is that IRAF does some very strange things with lowlevel pointers, and so I had to put in some black magic to modify some internal constants.  
  
See  
https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pull/10/commits/d862831be7652d1cc870f8ffc7b4975a97403e85  
  
for an example.

The symlinks enable multi-platform builds.  You can remove them, but would  
need to then also modify the mkfloat script and mkpkg task to look for  
libraries in a bin.<arch> directory instead of 'lib'.

For the record, when I pulled in the pull requests made to iraf/iraf-v216 to my branch oleboleUpdates the linux64 build now works and I'm able to run iraf. I have not seen the problems [@joequant](https://github.com/joequant) found three years ago - which I guess is good new.

Since the individual problems are covered in other issues (which are going to be closed automatically once the relevant PR is merged), maybe you close this one now?

**[RobSteele49](https://github.com/RobSteele49)** commented on 2017-05-13

it is up to iraf to close it, but I'll consider this issue closed as we have issues that are directed at the underlying problems.

But you can also close it yourself if you consider it solved. I would see no reason to keep it there, since the individual problems are tracked separately.
