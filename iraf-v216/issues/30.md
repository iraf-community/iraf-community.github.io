The library `libasttools.a` is getting compiled, but not installed. This leads to errors like  
```  
xc -Nz   -/g -/m64 -p noao x_astutil.o libpkg.a -lasttools -lxtools -lcurfit -lbev -o xx_astutil.e  
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lasttools  
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status  
```  
It can be probably fixed by adding the following to the `mkpkg` file.  
```  
install:  
	$move	libasttools.a noaobin$libasttools.a  
	;  
```  
Again wondering about QA on IRAF...   
  
Also, the directory `noao/astutil/noaolib` is missing, probably due to the move to git (which doesn' store empty directories).  
  
I will again prepare a pull request for that.

Update here: the proposed change doesn't help, the library is not moved to the final destination.  
The rationale that it should go to `noaobin$` is that this is the directory where an existing symlink points to:  
```  
$ ls -l noao/lib/libasttools.a  
lrwxrwxrwx 1 oles oles 20 Mai  4 10:47 noao/lib/libasttools.a -> ../bin/libasttool.a  
```  
and `noao/bin` points to `noao/bin.linux64` (since it is system dependent).  
  
Currently out of ideas here (likewise for [#31](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/31)).

Since I didn't encounter this during the last 14 days, I am closing. Should be reopened when it is discovered again after applying all patches.
