This git repository contains the version number in its name. This will be misleading when/if there is a new release. Changing the name later will break the configuration for all contributors. Therefore I would ask to rename the repository by removing the "-v216" part quickly.  
Other branches of the source (f.e. containing the full history) can always created as git branches.
