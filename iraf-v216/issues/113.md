This PR cleans up two issues with the readline library:  
  
## 1. Remove extra (unused) readline library  
      
The library in `pkg$vocl/readline/` is identical to the one in `vendor$readline/`. It also remains uncompiled and not used by VOCL at all. Therefore, it can be savely removed.  
VOCL uses as ECL and CL the library installed in `vendor$readline/`.  
  
## 2. Revert changes from GNU readline 5.0  
  
The readline code in IRAF originates in the version 5.0 of the GNU readline library. Aside from Makefile changes (to fit into the IRAF build system), there are only two changes: one whitespace-only change in `input.c`, and one change in `readline.c` which was (by rumor) thought to solve a memory leak. The latter is, however, a no-op:  
  
```C  
#define USE_STATIC  
// ...  
  
char * readline (prompt)  
const char *prompt;  
{  
 char *value = NULL; // was not initialized with NULL before  
#ifdef USE_STATIC  
  static char result[4096];  
#endif  
// ...  
      
#ifdef USE_STATIC  
  memset (result, 0, 4096);  
  if (value) {  
    strcpy (result, value);  
    free (value);  
  }  
  return (strdup (result));  
#else  
  return (value);  
#endif  
}  
```  
  
There was an initialization of `value` with `NULL` added, and the code within `USE_STATIC` (and the `#define` itself) was added.  
The code takes the original value that comes in `value`, copies it into a static area `result`, and then frees the original `value` (which [properly] assumes that `value` was allocated with `malloc` before). The copied string is then again duplicated (which implies creating the required size with `malloc`), and returned.  
  
The copied string does not differ from the original one: both are `malloc`ed and need to be `free`d by the caller. So, this does not fix a memory leak.  
  
Reverting this, however, makes the directory `vendor$readline/` identical to the original GNU readline (except the `Makefile.in` adaption, and the documentation), so that it is clear that it can be replaced by linking to the system's readline if wanted.  
  
I checked that this does not create an (additional) memory leak. Running `vocl.e` with valgrind shows in both cases (with and without this patch) identical behaviour:  
  
```  
HEAP SUMMARY:  
    in use at exit: 292,758 bytes in 216 blocks  
  total heap usage: 2,344 allocs, 2,128 frees, 4,188,024 bytes allocated  
  
LEAK SUMMARY:  
   definitely lost: 120,540 bytes in 20 blocks  
   indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks  
     possibly lost: 98 bytes in 1 blocks  
   still reachable: 172,120 bytes in 195 blocks  
        suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks  
Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory  
  
For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v  
ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)  
```  
  
This also stays stable when I do things in cl, so I don't see a real leak here.
