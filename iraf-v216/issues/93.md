As discussed in [#90](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/90), the VO resources shall go into a separate package, and then get updated to the latest VO interfaces to make it work again with the current VO infrastructure.  
  
This PR removes the VO from IRAF, with the exception of the `libvotable` vendor lib: `libvotable` is self-contained and offers read/write functionality for VOTables. This is quite stable and would be a significant functionality decrease if we would remove it.  
  
So, the following removals are done here:  
  
 * the `VO` subdir  
 * the `VOCL` package   
 * the `voclient` subdir from `vendor` (except `libvotable`)  
  
The PR is [tested to build in Travis](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/builds/247437075) (after applying [all other patches](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commits/5df865dfdade247807b1853d6407c7c0299acf11)).  
  
This will fix [#90](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/90).  
  
Functionality we will lose:  
  
 * `IMX_FETCH()` function and prefetching data if `vo_prefetch` is set in `sys/imio/imt/imxexpand.x`  
 * VOCL shell, with (f.e.) SAMP functionality (will be moved to an external package)  
 * all other VO packages (will be moved to an external package)  
 * VO related external programs, like Aladin, Topcat, and their direct call from within IRAF  
 * VO related command line utilities, like `votget` (will me moved to an external package)
