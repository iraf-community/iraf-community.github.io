When compiing for "linux" (32 bit), the created `rpp.e` hangs by endlessly looping in `unix/boot/spp/rpp/ratlibf/stlu.f`. Compilation was done on a 64-bit machine with a complete 32-bit userland installation in a chroot using Debian Stretch.This is the [loop in `stlu.r`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/spp/rpp/ratlibr/stlu.r#L22-L33):  
```  
   hash = mod (hash, ST_HTABSIZE) + 1  
  
   pred = st + hash  
   node = Mem (pred)  
   while (node != LAMBDA) {  
      i = 1  
      j = node + ST_DATA + nodsiz  
      while (symbol (i) == Mem (j)) {  
	 if (symbol (i) == EOS)  
	    return (YES)  
	 i = i + 1  
	 j = j + 1  
	 }  
      pred = node  
      node = Mem (pred + ST_LINK)  
      }  
```  
The `hash`  is set to the same value here as on 64 bit (`hash=40`), but `st` is different (32 bit: `st=59957`, 64 bit: `st=59851`), and also `node` is different (32 bit: `node=-2`, 64 bit: `node=59818`).
