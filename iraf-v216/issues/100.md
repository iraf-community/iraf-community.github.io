When a file is opened as a `STRING_FILE` (f.e. in [`sys/fio/fstrfp.x:21`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/fio/fstrfp.x#L21)) `FMODE` is also set to `STRING_FILE`, which translates to -1. This is, however, an illegal index to access `mmap`. The patch fixes this.
