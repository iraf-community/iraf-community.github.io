According [`notes-64bit`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/local/notes.64-bit#L437-L440), the files `sys/osb/i32to64.c` and `sys/osb/i64to32.c` were taken from the [IRAF64](http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/~cyamauch/iraf64/index.html) project ([@cyamauch](https://github.com/cyamauch)). This project has the [following license conditions](https://sourceforge.net/p/iraf64/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/LICENCE_IRAF64):  
```  
See COPYRIGHTS file for original IRAF.  
  
Do not remove CREDITS_IRAF64 and LICENCE_IRAF64 from IRAF package.  
  
Please display following message when starting IRAF shells;  
  
  This product includes results achieved by the IRAF64 project in 2006-  
  2009 directed by Chisato Yamauchi (C-SODA/ISAS/JAXA).  
```  
However, apart from the short notices in `notes.64-bit` and `notes.v214`, the project is neither mentioned in the IRAF shells, nor in the license documentation. IMO they should be credited somehow, preferably in the way they asked for.

Both files are [compiled](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/osb/mkpkg#L97-L98) into `libvops.a`, and they are used in [`miiupk32.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/osb/miiupk32.x#L34), [`miipk32.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/osb/miipak32.x#L60) and `stfwgpb.x` ([here](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/imio/iki/stf/stfwgpb.x#L93) and [here](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/imio/iki/stf/stfwgpb.x#L113)).  
An actual test with [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) also shows that the code is actually _used_.
