These libs (especially `libVO.a`) are required to build some of the libs, even in NOVOS mode.  
  
Together with [#38](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/38) (commit [46158661](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/461586615f01935e74d6bfe9ff0671f9785c180d)), this fixes [#26](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/26).
