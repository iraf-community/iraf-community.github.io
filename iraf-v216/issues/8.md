This is a placeholder for upgrading IRAF to handle fortran 95.  
In principle, this should be simple since everything gets compiled to assembly, but there is a big gotcha, and everything accept for one blocker works if you just replace the calls to f77 with a f95 native compiler.  
  
IRAF uses an internal dynamic memory system, and to locate the base of the dynamic memory, IRAF uses a dummy array with an equivalence and does pointer arithmetic from that variable.  The array is not a real array and is used only to get the base address of the dynamic memory.  
  
However, this creates a problem since fortran 95 views this as an invalid statement since it is hand creating a dynamic memory system that is unnecesary in fortran 95.  
  
Would like to throw out this issue to see if someone can come up with some fix.  It would be a big enhancement to be able to use f95 with IRAF.

Not quite:  The mem common equivalence has it's address fixed at zero (in  
the zsvjmp.s file) so that IRAF pointers are a simple multiple of the  
pointer address allocated in the iraf kernel (see unix$libc/kernel.h).  
Support for this is gradually eroding in some compilers and we may be  
forced to switch to using a dynamic base address, but this can be handled  
in the iraf kernel and memio interface.

Fortran is used in as an intermediate language in the compilation of SPP  
and by about 10% of the system in the form of legacy library code.  There's  
no proven benefit that compiling this code with an f95 compiler would be  
any faster and no new code being developed that would take advantage of F95  
language features.  Modifying the SPP compile chain to produce F95 code  
endangers the stability of the system with no way to test for bugs being  
introduced, and again with no proven benefit for the effort/risk.  I've  
experimented with things like using the Intel compilers or  
platform-optimized build flags and haven't seen enough speedup to warrant  
either a new iraf architecture or the disruption of requiring a  
non-standard compiler installation by the user.  
  
F95 support could be done in an experimental fork by interested developers  
but there are many more higher-priority items to be dealt with first.

1) The reason for using fortran 95 as a compilation system is that way people can start writing filters that use fortran95 functions.  Fortran 95 is a vast improvement over F77, and the whole point is to set up the system so that people can generate new f95 code.  
  
2) So we use travis ci to create an automated testing suite.  That's necessary in order to do anything non trivial  
  
3) Nice thing about having more developers is that people can figure out what's on their priority list

used for math libraries like SLALIB.  I don't see any desire in the  
community to develop new libraries and to specifically do so in F95.  I  
also don't see any benefit to changing to F95 as an intermediate language  
given what else needs to be changed to support it.  If you want to put  
effort into language support people will use, try python.
