On `macosx`, the file `zsvjmp_i386.s` was assembled without the flag `-mmacosx-version-min=10.5`, which makes the resulting binary incompatible to older MacOS X versions. Also, in this case, a warning is printed when the file is linked, which may confuse the user.  
  
The patch fixes this by simplifying `unix/os/mkpkg.sh`. Note, however, that the `mkpkg` file in this directory does not deal with the file `zsvjmp_i386.s` at all, so re-building with `mkpkg` will not work on `macosx`. `mkpkg` is however not used in `unix/os/` to build IRAF, so this may be ignored.  
  
We _could_ however just rename  `zsvjmp_i386.s` to  `zsvjmp.s`, since there is probably no need ever to create a binary for MacOSX on PowerPC (latest hardware was released ~2006...). That is again something that should be decided by [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf).
