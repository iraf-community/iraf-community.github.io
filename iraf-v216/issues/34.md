When compiling IRAF from source, one is advised to first run the `install` command from the root of the IRAF source tree. Independent of what is entered as the paths there, the script   
  
* adds and populates the `~/.iraf` subdir,  
* creates a symling `~/.imtoolsrc` pointing into the IRAF source,  
* adds several rc files to your home, namely `.bash_login`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.bashrc.bak`, `.cshrc`, `.cshrc.bak`, `.login`, `.profile`. `.tcshrc`, even if one is using bash and not [t]csh.  
* changes the IRAF paths that were set there to the IRAF source  
  
If the compilation is not used finally, this destroys the user setup of the local installation, so that a user trying out to compile IRAF is then left with his production setup not working anymore.
