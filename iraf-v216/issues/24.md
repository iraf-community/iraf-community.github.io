The sticky bit is set for `/tmp` for a reason, removing it creates a security hole.  
And the intended usage (multiuser tape allocation) is very rarely used today.  
  
If this is really needed for some use cases, please document it instead, and let the system administrator decide how to proceed here.  
  
This will fix [#23](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/23).
