The `./install` script [contains the following piece](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/b16ce716abfe1a06c406a2ffd0eafccada99f49e/install#L1165-L1172):  
```  
if (( "do_system"==1 )); then  
    # Allow deletion of files in /tmp - needed for multiuser tape allocation.  
    ECHO -n "Reset /tmp sticky bit setting ...                              "  
    if [ "$exec" == "yes" ]; then  
        chmod -t /tmp  
    fi  
    DO_OK  
fi  
```  
This is a crude hack, removing a [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit) on the `/tmp` directory that ensures that people cannot delete or rename other people's files from there which by purpose opens a number of security holes on multiuser systems -- without any gain. Or who is still using "multiuser tape allocation" with IRAF?

I spend some time to find out _where_ this multiuser tape allocation actually happens. The places in questions were [`alloc.c`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/alloc.c) (or maybe [`zalloc.c`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zalloc.c)); but they refer to devices in `/dev` only. And also, `alloc.e` is a setuid program that does not need the sticky bit.  
  
There is an [entry in the FAQ](http://iraf.noao.edu/faq/FAQsec09.html#9011) that is related, but it is for VMS, and I couldn't find the creation of the mentioned file/directory. There is also an [old question in the forum](http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=110948), but this is almost 20 years old.  
  
So it is quite unclear why [these lines](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/install#L1165-L1172) are in the install script.

OK, I found the place: [`sys/mtio/mtio.h`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/mtio/mtio.h#L5-L7), which defines it as `/tmp/mt?.lok`. This violates the [Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLOCKLOCKFILES); at least on Linux it should therefore go to `/var/lock`.  
  
And since `/var/lock/` also has the sticky bit set, the correct solution here would IMO be to create a world writable subdirectory there and to put the lock files into that. If there are still any tape users on IRAF left.  
  
[@iraf](https://github.com/iraf)? What is your opinion on that?
