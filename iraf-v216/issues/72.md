When I try to build the 32-bit-version on a 64-bit platform,the compilation fails both on [MacOS](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/233881437) and [Linux](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/233881434), due to a number of reasons, even when all required dependencies are available.  
  
One reason is that on many places not `IRAFARCH` is used, but instead the architecture is guessed again based on the actual system, which will produce an inconsistent build that later fails.  
Another reason is that the `-m32`  flag is used on most of the places, but not consequently.  
  
Having this buildable would be a great advantage, since it allows a good continious integration on Travis.
