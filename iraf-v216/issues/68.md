curl is available on both Linux and MacOSX, and the header files need to be preinstalled anyway (#58). On MacOSX, this version is used anyway. So, there is noreason to build curl on Linux.  
  
Since there was no response to [#58](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/58), here is my proposal:  
This patch just removes it. And so closes [#58](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/58).  
  
Note that that PR will requires some adjustment after [#38](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/38) was applied -- this is because there are now so many PRs in the queue that it is impossible to make them all independently cleanly applying.  
As reference: [93732e09](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/93732e09080898ced305b60a8a8a2a5e0be382e1) is (almost) the same patch, but with scripts converted to `/bin/sh`.
