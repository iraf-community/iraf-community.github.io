The short story is I'm getting the error in the output of the make World:  
  
/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/5/include/varargs.h:4:2: error: #error "GCC no longer implements <varargs.h>."  
 #error "GCC no longer implements <varargs.h>.  
  
if anyone is interested in seeing more data you can look in steelewool/iraf-v261 in the branch x11iraf.

x11iraf does not compile on 64-bit and never did. IMO it should be removed anyway from the source tree and put into a separate repository.
