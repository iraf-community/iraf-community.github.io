The lex file `unix/boot/spp/xpp/xpp.l` could not be processed by recent lex programs (f.e. flex), since the resulting `lex.yy.c` files were patched, and the patch depended tightly on interna of the lex program originally used (which is not documented). Since "modern" (since ~30 years) flex programs have more flexibility, the patches are not needed anymore and can be replaced by appropriate standard conform solutions.  
  
Similarly for `unix/boot/generic/tok.l`; here is however the difficulty that it needs to re-read parts of the file to do loops. This is solved by explicitly counting chars read-in, see the [discussion on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44266589/going-back-to-old-position-in-lex).  
  
There is one (or three, depending on how one counts it) more lex sources, `pkg/*cl/grammar.l`, but much harder to solve: Here, not the system libc is used, but the (incomplete) IRAF libc. The generated `lex.yy.c` depend f.e. on the existence of `<string.h>`, which is not available in IRAF libc. So, we will leave the CL grammars as they are for the moment. Patches are welcome here however :-)
