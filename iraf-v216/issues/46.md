For some reasons, the directory structure of the bindirs in the `vo` subdir got lost, and it is not automatically regenerated during build.  
  
So, here comes it back. For some reasons, the MacOS bindirs were even not present in the 2.16.1 tarball?

The VO package is removed from the iraf-community repository, therefore I am closing this.
