Yeat another removal:  
  
Since the rule "doppelt hält besser" does not apply to libraries, we will just remove this secondary link and its references. It was not built anyway. And issuing `make clean` and similar on a symlink looks weird: it should be cleaned already on its original place.  
  
There is another unused (and hopelessly outdated) cfitsio copy in `pkg/tbtables`, which was part of a (unfinished) attempt to switch tbtables to cfitsio. Since this is probably not going to happen, we can savely remove this copy. This also helps to clear the code from Numerical Recipes code (#37).
