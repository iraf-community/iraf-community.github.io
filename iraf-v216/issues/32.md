My 'hack' to fix this is to just remove these links and recreate them early in the make process. But, this is really not a long term fix. I'm wondering if someone else has seen this and  if there is a long term fix?  
  
ls -lt bytmov.c d1mach.f i1mach.f r1mach.f   
  
lrwxrwxrwx 1 steele steele 27 May  4 09:18 bytmov.c -> /iraf/iraf/unix/as/bytmov.c  
lrwxrwxrwx 1 steele steele 29 May  4 09:18 d1mach.f -> /iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/d1mach.f  
lrwxrwxrwx 1 steele steele 29 May  4 09:18 i1mach.f -> /iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/i1mach.f  
lrwxrwxrwx 1 steele steele 29 May  4 09:18 r1mach.f -> /iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/r1mach.f  
steele@steele-VirtualBox:~/git/iraf-v216/sys/osb$   
  
At least the directory /iraf/iraf doesn't exist on my system.  
  
Fixed the text via olebole's suggestion. Since I did not make these links, but they rather were the result of the install/make process I was just curious if someone knew where they were coming from and how to make a longterm fix.

IMO these files should just be symlinks to `../../unix/as/bytmov.c`, `../../unix/hlib/d1mach.f`, `../../unix/hlib/i1mach.f`, and `../../unix/hlib/r1mach.f`. The mistake here was to take absolute links instead of relative..  
  
  
BTW, please check your messages before sending them. There is a "preview" button, and you have also some basic style elements (`code`, text, __bold__, etc.). Make it easy to read for others. Specifically this one looks really ugly. And there is no need to "@" mention us on any subject.

I'm curious if anyone know why most of the .c and .f files in /sys/osb reside there directly but the 4 files I indicated above are softlnks to the actually files. One possible  fix is to copy the files from where the links are pointing to. But, that would mean there are multiple locations for the same file.  
  
ls *.[cf]  
abs.c     achtbs.c  achtib.c  achtsu.c  achtus.c  bitfields.c  bytmov.f  f77upk.f   ipak32.c  r1mach.f  zzeps2.f

At least for `bytemov.c`, the resolution is system dependent, and therefore the symlink is a possible solution. This is fixed in [#33](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/33) (see also the link above this message).  
  
BTW, if you enclose a code section in two lines  ` ``` `, you can use all characters, and the text is nicely formatted as code. This makes the text more readable.

As the change olebole made fixes this issue I'm going to close it. Thanks.

You don't need to close; it will automatically be closed once my pull request is accepted. If Mike does not accept it, it will stay open then.
