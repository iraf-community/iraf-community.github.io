When starting xgterm, the `TERM` variable has the wrong value:  
  
```  
$ echo $TERM  
vt100  
```  
  
The reason is that xgterm tries to get the value from the `terminfo` database, which does not contain an entry for `xgterm`, and then falls back to `vt100`.  
  
An way to install xgterm in the database is to call the `tic` terminfo compiler with the following file as argument (tic is part of the ncurses binaries):  
  
```  
# xgterm.terminfo: Terminfo entry source for xgterm  
# compile with "tic xgterm.terminfo"  
xgterm|graphic terminal for IRAF,  
	use=xterm-r5,  
```  
  
This will compile and install a database entry in the home directory (resp. in the standard terminfo dir, when compiled as root) and so allows xgterm to set the correct `TERM` variable.  
  
```  
$ echo $TERM  
xgterm  
```  
  
This should be part of the IRAF installation procedure.
