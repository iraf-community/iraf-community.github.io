I'll test this out on the official buid and will post those results here.

Just saw this post on iraf.net:  
  
You can find the solution here:  
https://code.google.com/archive/p/myrafproject/issues/13  
http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=1467939  
  
Which claims to fix the problem. I tested using the linux64 version I just downloaded from http://iraf.noao.edu/ The error was the exact same as with the software I've built.

The defaults for darkcombine use 'ccdtype = "dark"'. With this option darkcombine can't find any of my images. It seems that this option should be left for the user to specify. I also had to change process from yes to no. Without the change to process I got:  
  
List of dark images to combine ([@origList](https://github.com/origList)):   
ERROR: No bad pixel mask found

The latest version (5/25/17) of the code doesn't work until I set the parameter for process to no.
