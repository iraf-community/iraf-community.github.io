When a file to be opened could not be found, the outer loop in the function [is left via `break`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/bootlib/envinit.c#L218-L221), but then the file pointer `fp` is [tried to be closed](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/bootlib/envinit.c#L267), which leads to a segementation fault (since it is `NULL`).  
  
This patch checks the file pointer to be not `NULL` before closing and fixes this.
