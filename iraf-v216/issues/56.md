Here the ccdtype was defaulted to flat. Changed that to null. process was set to yes, changed that to no to get the function to not fail. This is really similar to issue [#55](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/55).   
  
The message when process was set to 'yes' was:  
  
ccdred> flatcombine  
List of flat field images to combine ([@origList](https://github.com/origList)):   
ERROR: No bad pixel mask found  
  "ccdproc (ims, output="", ccdtype=ccdtype, noproc=no)"
