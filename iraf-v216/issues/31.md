Another one... IRAF is so much fun.

When trying to build `noao/onedspec/smw`, the following error appears:
```

The way I solved this was to take all of the PRs from olebole and steelewool and I'm now building this .a in my branch oleboleUpdates in steelewool/iraf-v216. Unless [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) has a fix I'd recommend just merging the relevant PRs.

Since I didn't encounter this during the last 14 days, I am closing. Should be reopened when it is discovered again after applying all patches.

I have a copy of Ole's merge-all in my steelewool repository. I was not getting the files libasttools.a and libsmw.a created until I created the directories  noao/astutil/noaolib and noao/onedspec/noaolib. I'm just curious if these directories were necessary for Ole to build? If they are necessary what mechanism would be the 'recommended' way to create them. As a hack I created the files and have README in each of them in my olebole/merge-all branch. I would also be curious if iraf has these directories in his local area?

If you're seeing 'noaolib' in any of the paths it means your environment is
messed up somehow, i.e. the 'noaolib$' logical path used in the mkpkg files
isn't being resolved to something like '/iraf/iraf/noao/lib'.  There should
NOT be an 'noaolib' anywhere.

Fixed my environment and that resolved the problem. Thanks.

Would you provide a pull request for that?

Using my branch which is tracking your (Ole's) mege-all branch after I did a clean build (./install; /make linux64; make sysgen)  the library files libsmw.a and libasttools.a were both built correctly and in the correct location. The noaolib problem effectively went away.
