This fixes a problem that `rpp.e` does not work correctly when build with optimization: since `cdsmem` is initialized everywhere in ratlib as `integer mem(1)` the C compiler (after f2c) assumes that the variable is not an array, but a pointer to a single variable, and any subsequent write can be replaced by just writing the last value.  
  
It should really be a `integer mem(60000)` (resp. `MEMSIZE` in the ratfor source).  
  
This closes [#59](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/59) and closes [#73](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/73). The second patch also closes [#53](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/53).
