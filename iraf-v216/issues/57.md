This patch is taken from PR [#10](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/10) by [@joequant](https://github.com/joequant) (commit [d862831b](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/d862831be7652d1cc870f8ffc7b4975a97403e85)).  
  
This is necessary for GCC 4.8 to properly generate SSE2 double word aligned move instructions.  See  
  
https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11507  
  
for discussion of this issue. Citing from there ([@joequant](https://github.com/joequant)):  
>If you have several double assigns in a row, gcc will attempt to optimize it with a streaming double instruction.  
>The trouble is that for this to work, the doubles have to be aligned on a 16-byte boundary, which is not guaranteed by salloc.  
  
>For SSE2 to work doubles have to be aligned on 128-bit boundaries so I changed the IRAF memory management so that happens.  
  
It fixes [#53](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/53) .
