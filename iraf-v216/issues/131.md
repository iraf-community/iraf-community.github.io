On many systems, background jobs don't work well:  
```  
cl> bases 233 &  
[1]  
cl> BKG ERROR: new CL installed; logout and try again  
```  
This is independent of the used shell (`cl.e`/`ecl.e`/`vocl.e`).  
The reason is that in [`pkg/[ve]cl/bg.c](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/pkg/ecl/bkg.c#L601-L605), the pointer of the dictionary in the new executable is directly compared with that pointer in the parent (transferred via the background status file).  
There is however no guarantee that the pointer to statically allocated memory is the same in two subsequent calls of a program! Specifically with PIE enabled systems (Debian Stretch, newer Ubuntu versions) this is not the case anymore. And [a discussion on iraf.net](https://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=1467431&fromblock=yes) suggests that this is also not the case for newer macos versions.
