If the data size was between `SZ_INT` and `SZ_MEMALIGN` (2<4<8), IRAF crashed on 32 bit because of an integer division by zero. This patch fixes this.  
  
Closes [#63](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/63)   
  
After this (and all the PRs before), the "linux" branch passes [initial tests](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/39d5372cf98980da3c2d6e6a6dc387b04c8b0a7a/test/testproc.md).
