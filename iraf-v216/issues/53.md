I followed the file [`testproc.ps.Z`](http://iraf.noao.edu/iraf/ftp/iraf/docs/testproc.ps.Z) for some basic tests. There, the `listpix` command does not work as expected:  
```  
ecl> listpix dev$pix[300:305, 200:205]  
ERROR: singular matrix  
```  
If I omit section `[300:305, 200:205]`, I get a result. The other use of sections in the test procedure works, but then again plotting doesn't work:  
```  
ecl> imcopy dev$pix[300:305,200:205] image.sect  
dev$pix[300:305,200:205] -> image.sect  
ecl> imhead image.sect  
image.sect[6,6][short]: m51  B  600s  
ecl> listpix image.sect  
Warning: setting LTM2_2 to 1.  
ERROR: singular matrix  
```

Works for me, linux and OSX.  'Singular matrix' sounds like an issue in  
MWCS.

So it comes from the WCS? But there is none in the image? An image copied without section has the following header:

Pixel coords are a form of WCS.  See sys$mwcs/mwlu.x for your error message  
and trace it backwards.

IMO the section routine writes an incomplete WCS: it writes a `WCSDIM`, but no further WCS info. And this is then not taken as a unity matrix, but as a zero one.

Keywords aren't necessarily written when they are the default value anyway  
(typically zero values).  This has worked for 20+ years this way so you've  
changed something ......

Just for clarification which version of IRAF and which OS are you seeing this error. Is there any chance that the old version of testproc might not have the correct syntax?
- - - -

**[olebole](https://github.com/olebole)** commented on 2017-05-11

@RobSteele49 the syntax didn't change.  OS is Linux.  
[@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) All changes are documented as pull requests here -- the ones I proposed, and [#39](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/39). There is nothing that could influence the `sys/mws` subdir -- none of the PRs touches this. These are the changes between the current `master` branch and my work with respect to the `sys` subdir.  
  
* adjusting the symlinks to be relative (#33):  
  - `sys/osb/bytmov.c` -> `../../unix/as/bytmov.c` instead of `/iraf/iraf/unix/as/bytmov.c`  
  - `sys/osb/d1mach.f` -> `../../unix/hlib/d1mach.f` instead of `/iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/d1mach.f`

  - `sys/osb/r1mach.f` -> `../../unix/hlib/r1mach.f` instead of `/iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/r1mach.f`  
  
* regenerated several `acht*.x` files. I didn't remove then, but they are still newly generated during the build (contrary to [what you said](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pull/25#issuecomment-298861155)).

So, unless one of these changes caused the problem, it may be something like a more modern compiler -- changed zeroing of local variables or so.

The added header

```  
WCSDIM  =                    2  
LTV1    =                -299.  
```  
is different from what is produced by the binary `x_images.e`:  
```  
WCSDIM  =                    2  
LTV1    =                -299.  
LTV2    =                -199.  
LTM1_1  =                   1.  
LTM2_2  =                   1.  
WAT0_001= 'system=physical'  
WAT1_001= 'wtype=linear'  
WAT2_001= 'wtype=linear'  
```  
so one problem seems to be that the generated LTV information is incomplete.  
However, if I read this file (generated by the binary `x_images.e`) with the self-compiled `x_images.e`, I still get the singular matrix, so reading in doesn't work either.  
As said before, nothing changed in `mwcs` between master and current version.

Since the master in iraf/iraf-v216 doesn't build it seems that this is the primary problem that needs to be solved - with this item on the queue after that.  I'm using gcc version gcc (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4) 5.4.0 20160609. I'm getting the same results my current build (branch oleboleUpdates on my fork in steelewool/iraf-v216. On that branch I've pulled in all of olebole's pull requests.  
  
I'm curious which version of the compiler iraf is using. Could you (iraf) do a gcc --version on the compiler you did the build on? That way we can compare things.  
  
I'm assuming that the system builds for iraf when the architecture is set for linux64. Is that assumption correct?

Because Git destroys the file dates and so the 'ifolder' check in the mkpkg  
file fails.

The loop index order is changed and so this is overwriting data when the  
input/output arrays are the same.  This implies you did something to change  
the sizeof() data types and likely this is a 64-bit problem you introduced  
affecting all tasks.  Does LISTPIX work on 32-bit.

Keep guessing, v2.16.1 was compiled with whatever the stock linux/osx
compiler was in 2013 on a recent platform.

As far as I understand, these files should be re-generated on a new build because they depend on the data size on the platform, right? So it is not a file-date problem -- they are [regenerated unconditionally](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/vops/mkpkg#L28-L29).  
And when looking into the data size in `unix/hlib/iraf.h` (symlink to [`iraf64.h`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/hlib/iraf64.h#L51-L54)), then the changes are as expected:  
```  
define  SZ_INT          4  
[...]  
define  SZ_DOUBLE       4  
```  
This means f.e. for `ak/achtid.x` (conversion int to double) that one can iterate forward, this is also how it is [defined in `acht.gx`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/vops/acht.gx#L20-L21), and this is exactly the change shown above. The `ak/acht??.x` files in the git repository are thereofore from a 32-bit installation. I also pragmatically tested that using them doesn't solve the problem.  
So it is not that I magically redefined the size of the data types. The cause must be somewhere different.  
  
> Does LISTPIX work on 32-bit.  
  
No, it doesn't work on any data size.

To list the specific changes against the current master; I applied only those that are absolutely necessary to compile IRAF (BTW, it would really be nice if you could review them and merge if you think they are OK).  
  
* [#22](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/22) - Add `libc/libc.h` to `PATHFILES` in `install`  
* [#33](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/33) - Replace absolute symlinks in `sys/osb` by relative ones  
* [#38](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/38) - Convert `mklibs` etc. to `/bin/sh` in `vendor`  
* [#39](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/39) - Remove `-L/usr/lib64` from `LFLAGS`  
* [#40](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/40) - Build vendor libs before starting the NOVOS build  
* [#45](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/45) - Call the PLT for `__sigsetjmp` instead of calling directly in `zsvjmp.s`  
* [#46](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/46) - (Re-)add bin.* directory structure to `vo` subdir  
* [b95f7e0f](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/b95f7e0f625eb90352a8120a71dd59be95e0e9bd) - Remove `.BASE` files in `vendor/voclient`, part of [#25](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/25)  
  
I don't see that any of these changes could cause the problem.

The object files say it was `GNU C 4.4.6 20120305 (Red Hat 4.4.6-4)`. What if you recompile on a modern platform?

What if you recompile on a less-modern platform (you already know a GCC  
version that doesn't show the problem)?  Compiler version is highly  
unlikely to be the problem (based on experience), although you should be  
cautious if any of the optimization levels were changed (even then,  
optimizer problems are rare).  If it is a compiler version, you'll need to  
track the bug to fix it.  If it isn't a compiler bug, you'll still need to  
track the bug to fix it.

I am trying to (specifically I installed a Debian Squeeze with gcc-4.4.5), but then I run into other build problems which I first have to fix. Maybe you could in turn try out a modern system?  
  
> although you should be cautious if any of the optimization levels were changed (even then, optimizer problems are rare)  
  
Again (you seem to ignore me with that respect): All changes I made are well-documented (see above), and the tests are done on a clean system. I didn't change any optimization level as I didn't change anything that is not documented above. It would be great if you could go through this list and give your opinion whether this is acceptable (and then merge it) or what the problem with that patch is.

I'll be honest:  I'm not even gonna pretend I'll look at any of this for at  
least a month, I have another project release that takes priority.  Merging  
a trivial file deletion doesn't really help and I don't have time for any  
more than that.  So, carry on and continue to submit PRs and work on your  
own branch, I'll get back to this when I can.

The file deletion in [b95f7e0f](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/b95f7e0f625eb90352a8120a71dd59be95e0e9bd) is actually required to build from source. And generally, deleting files that are not required to build the system helps others (like me) to understand the code better. And it may prevent from accidently using precompiled files instead of sources.  
  
> So, carry on and continue to submit PRs and work on your own branch, I'll get back to this when I can.  
  
That would be great.
