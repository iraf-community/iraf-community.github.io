This pull request removes outdated unused code from the unix subdir:  
  
* `mc6800`, `portkit`, `shlib`, `sun`: this is for architectures that are unsupported and non-existend since quite a while  
* graphics devices iism70/55 and m70vms  
* `vmcached`: outdated by the possibility to use a ramdisk  
* all unsupported `as.*` and `bin.*`  
  
The code removal covers _only_ code that is not compiled anymore, so it does not change the features of the binaries (since it does not change the binaries at all).  
  
It also cleans up the `f2c.h` usage by using a common version everywhere (they differed anyway only on common details).  
  
System specific flags like `REDHAT`, `LINUX64`, `MACH64` etc. are now replaced by standard pre-defined flags like `__linux__`, `__LP64__`, `__APPLE__`. Also, `#ifdef`s for unused systems is removed. This simplifies the code itself and also required build flags, making future maintenance and porting easier.  
  
Needless to say (or maybe required, based on the discussion so far): This is tested, on Mac and Linux, from old systems (Debian back to 2009; SLC 6, Fedora 23) up to the current versions. So it is sure that the `#defines` used are really there and work as expected, and that the external libs have the required functionality.  
  
This fixes [#12](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/12)
