The code in `noao$digiphot/photcal/prcode.x` and `noao$digiphot/photcal/preval.gx` intermix access to the `Memi` and `Memr` fields with the same pointers. For example the following [lines in `prcode.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/noao/digiphot/photcal/parser/prcode.x#L181-L183):  
```  
Memi[code + cp - 1] = PEV_NUMBER  
cp = cp + 1  
Memr[code + cp - 1] = value  
```  
or [in `preval.gx`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/noao/digiphot/photcal/parser/preval.gx#L89-L101):  
```  
case PEV_NUMBER:  
    ip = ip + 1  
    sp = sp + 1  
    stack[sp] = Memr[code + ip]  
    if (IS_INDEFR (stack[sp]))  
        break  
  
case PEV_CATVAR:  
    ip = ip + 1  
    sp = sp + 1  
    stack[sp] = vdata[Memi[code + ip]]  
    if (IS_INDEFR (stack[sp]))  
        break  
```  
  
This works on 32 bit, when the length of `real` and `int` are equal (4 bytes). On 64 bit (ILP64), however, `real` is still 4 bytes, while `int` has 8 bytes, and so one cannot use `Memr` and `Memi` access from the same pointer: `Memr[ptr]` will get the value from a _different_ place in memory than `Memi[ptr]`. Depending on how the pointer was created, either the first or the second will cause an illegal memory access.  
  
On 64 bit, this could be avoided by accessing `Memd` instead of `Memr`, since `double` also has a length of 8 bytes. This, however, does not solve [#128](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/128); therefore it is an independent bug.
