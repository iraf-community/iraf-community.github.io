Currently, the line number calculation of xc is wrong:  
  
File `hello.x` (line numbers added):  
```  
1   # HELLO -- Sample program introducing SPP.  
2   task hello = t_hello_world  
3   procedure t_hello_world ()  
4   begin  
5       call printf ("Hello,world!\n")  
6   end  
```  
  
Source code line 5 ends up marked as line 7 in the Fortran file:  
  
```  
$ xc -x -f hello.x  
   sys_runtask:  
   t_hello_world:  
$ tail -22 hello.f|head -11  
      subroutine thelld ()  
      integer*2 st0001(14)  
      save  
      integer iyy  
      data (st0001(iyy),iyy= 1, 8) / 72,101,108,108,111, 44,119,111/  
      data (st0001(iyy),iyy= 9,14) /114,108,100, 33, 10, 0/  
#line 7 "hello.x"  
         call xprinf(st0001)  
100      call zzepro  
         return  
      end  
```  
  
First, [when `begin` is parsed](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/spp/xpp/xpp.l#L120), the end of line `\n` is not eaten up. In fact, there may be code following after `begin` on the same line; this is placed after xpp in the line after `begin`. If nothing follows the `begin` statement on the same line, an empty line is added. This means, that `linenum` must __not__ increase here; it is increased [when the `\n` of this line is found](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/spp/xpp/xpp.l#L203).  
  
Similar argument for [parsing a `task` line](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/spp/xpp/xpp.l#L107); `linenum` must __not__ increase here as well.  
  
 Also, when processing include files, [an additional '\n' is included](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/spp/xpp/xpp.l#L415), which is later counted. To revert this effect, `linenum` has to be decreased here as  well.  
      
 When parsing `.help` ... `.endhelp` however, one `linenum` increase was missing, which is added now.  
  
Another problem is that the resulting intermediate file (output of spp; input for rpp) may contain content from include files, f.e. `lib/sysruk.x`. The line number protocol between spp and rpp does not allow to specify filenames, and spp suppresses the line number output of include files. However, rpp then interprets these lines as coming from the original file name and this way assigns wrong line numbers. Since files are included (explicitly or implicitly) in the beginning of the source file, this is pragmatically solved by supressing the output of line numbers before an explicit line number has been set by spp.  
  
This (re-) enables the possibility to directly debug SPP code (note that the flag to enable debugging in xc is `-x`, not `-g`):  
```  
$ xc -x hello.x  
   sys_runtask:  
   t_hello_world:  
$ gdb ./hello.e   
GNU gdb (Debian 7.12-6) 7.12.0.20161007-git  
[...]  
Reading symbols from ./hello.e...done.  
(gdb) b thelld_   
Breakpoint 1 at 0x38e7: file hello.x, line 5.  
(gdb) r  
Starting program: ./hello.e   
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]  
Using host libthread_db library "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libthread_db.so.1".  
> hello  
  
Breakpoint 1, thelld_ () at hello.x:5  
5	    call printf ("Hello,world!\n")  
(gdb) n  
Hello,world!  
6	end  
(gdb)  
```  
Connected to this, the wrong debug flag given in `irafuser.sh` is corrected as well.  
I also added a [test for the proper line number generation](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pull/36/commits/95da2c0f36e93216ef332a3479f0ebc5b33e092b) to [#36](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/36).
