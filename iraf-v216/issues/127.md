Generally, the size of a structure is not just the sum of the sizes of its members, since padding may require additional space. For `Dimblock`, [this is the case](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/f2c/src/defs.h#L636-L637), since the first member is an `int`, and the next one is a pointer: on 64-bit platforms, `int` is 4 bytes, while pointers are 8 bytes and therefore 4 bytes padding are inserted.  
  
This patch fixes the allocated size by using the real size of the structure.  
  
The patch also sets the length of the `dims` member to unspecified, to avoid compilers to optimize out the access to the member. See [#60](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/60) for fixes of other similar issues.  
  
With this patch, `f2c.e` does not complain anymore when sanitized for memory error (tested on 64 bit x86). The created code works perfectly on all platforms, as tested [here](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/builds/331724536).
