`curl/types.h` is deprecated since a loooong time. And it is removed since 6 years. Therefore, the code does not build anymore on MacOSX which ships with a more modern version of curl (#49).   
Even with the version that is included in IRAF (7.20.1, 7 years old) `curl/types.h` is not required to be included. So we can just remove it.  
  
This fixes [#49](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/49).
