Some linux distributions (like Debian) use zero for timestamps and uids/gids by default to enable reproducible builds. mkpkg however depends on the time stamp to check if an object file was updated. So, we explicitly re-enable it.  
  
This fixes [#64](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/64).
