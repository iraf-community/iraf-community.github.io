To change the size of `INTEGER` to 64 bit it is __not enough__ to just patch `f2c.h`, also the length of an integer must be adjusted in the f2c sources, since it is f.e. needed to determine the largest type to use in an `EQUIVALENCE` statement. Otherwise, the wrong type may be used there as the general type. This happens f.e. in [`ieeer.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/osb/ieeer.x#L101-L105):  
  
```  
int	expon, i, val  
real	fval  
int	ival[1]  
%	equivalence (fval, ival)  
%	equivalence (ival, val)  
```  
  
translates by the current `f2c.e` to  
  
```C  
    static real equiv_1[1];  
  
    /* Local variables */  
    static integer i__;  
#define val ((integer *)equiv_1)  
#define fval (equiv_1)  
#define ival ((integer *)equiv_1)  
```  
  
This is wrong: on ILP64, `real` is a 4-byte floating point, while `integer` is an 8-byte integer. Dereferencing [`ival`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/osb/ieeer.x#L120) will therefore cause reading memory outside of the definition of `rval`, which is an error and may cause segmentation faults. The reason is that `f2c.e` uses the variable with the largest size for storage, and since in the original f2c code `real` and `integer` are both 4 bytes, it has the freedom to use either of them (and choosed `real`).  
  
This PR changes the size of `INTEGER` to 8 bytes on 64 bit platforms, in conformance with its length specified in `f2c.h`. Then, the definition is properly changed to `integer` on those platforms.
