The address LOC needs to be not negative. The right shift in the original code however may be (implementation dependent) shift in a 1, resulting in a negative LOC:  
  
_ISO/IEC 9899/1999, §6.5.8_:  
> 5. The result of `E1 >> E2` is `E1` right-shifted `E2` bit positions. If `E1` has an unsigned type or if `E1` has a signed type and a nonnegative value, the value of the result is the integral part of the quotient of `E1 / 2^E2`. If `E1` has a signed type and a negative value, the resulting value is implementation-defined.  
  
We explicitly cast it  into an unsigned before rightshifting. This will shift in a zero.  
  
This fixes [#61](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/61).  
  
We can also remove an ugly "workaround" for this problem in the cl startup shell script.
