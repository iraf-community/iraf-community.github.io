Both MacOSX and Linux have the expat library available: MacOS by default, Linux as `expat-devel` package (Redhat world) resp. `libexpat1-dev` (Debian world). So there is no need to ship and build a copy.  
  
This PR has (trivial) conflicts with [#68](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/68); they can easily be resolved. When both PRs are applied, it also makes sense to remove the whole subdirectory `vendor/voclient/common/` (which is then basically empty) and adjust `vendor/voclient/Makefile` & Co. accordingly. See commit [a5ef0635](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/a5ef0635d89b4b6d65766746d8de0d7ea710eb68) which removes expat on top of curl.
