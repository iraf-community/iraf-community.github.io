The IRAF64 project contributed a number of bugfixes and some code to IRAF, specifically the files `sys/osb/i32to64.c` and `sys/osb/i64to32.c`.  
  
As asked by [@cyamauch](https://github.com/cyamauch), this patch acknowledges this by obeying the license conditions of IRAF64, and adding a copyright statement to the two mentioned files.  
  
This closes [#92](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/92).
