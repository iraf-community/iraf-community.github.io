Newer Linux systems (Fedora, Arch Linux, Debian) compile binaries with gcc by default as [Position Independent Executables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#PIE).  
  
During the start of a PIE executable, all symbols are relocated and get a new value. This affects the `mem_` symbol [defined in `zsvjmp.s`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/eb2d3d477aa1dc368576e045807c30594cae0488/unix/as.linux64/zsvjmp.s#L37), which is no longer 0 after startup on these systems:  
  
```  
$ cat memtest.c  
#include <stdio.h>  
  
extern int mem_;  
  
int main(void) {  
  printf("%p\n", &mem_);  
  return 0;  
}  
$ gcc zsvjmp.s memtest.c -o memtest  
$ ./memtest  
0x55bc774d1000  
```  
  
This becomes a problem, when `malloc()` returns a pointer below the address of `mem_`, since this results in a negative value for `bufptr` in [`mgdptr.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/nmemio/mgdptr.x#L30), which finally leads to a  memory corruption [reported by `mgtfwa.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/nmemio/mgtfwa.x#L23-L24).  
  
To reproduce, compile IRAF with PIE enabled, set the stacksize to unlimited (`ulimit -s unlimited`), start cl and run  
  
```  
cl> help help  
Memory fwa has been corrupted  
```  
  
See also [this stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46662310/how-to-create-a-non-relocatable-symbol?noredirect=1#comment80301590_46662310) about the problem.  
  
There are basically two ways to deal with this: First, one can just [disable PIE](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pull/12/commits/d76882df4178eb29cb16b8fbb07bc460e07a259c) during the compilation. Then, the `mem_` symbol is kept as zero, and the problem disappears (and the help works as expected):  
  
```  
$ gcc zsvjmp.s memtest.c -o memtest -no-pie  
$ ./memtest  
(nil)  
```  
  
The disadvantage is however, that the `-no-pie` linker option is quite recent and [does not exist on older machines](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/286688801#L713), so unconditionally setting this will break backward compatibility. On newer systems, this flag however would need to be set in any case, also when compiling tasks written by the user.  
  
The other way would be to fix the misbehaviour with negative indices. Differently to `zmalloc()`, which provides absolute indices not related to `mem_`, negative values should be not a problem for `kmalloc`/`krealloc`, which handle indices relative to `mem_`. One place where negative values are handled improperly is the [use of `mod()` in `mgdptr.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/nmemio/mgdptr.x#L25) which returns a negative result for negative input. The other place is `coerce.x`, which [uses integer division](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/286688801) (which rounds into the wrong direction for negative values: towards zero instead of towards the smaller value).
