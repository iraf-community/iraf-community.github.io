When running `make src`, the generated files  
```  
unix/bin.linux64/f2c.e  
unix/bin.linux64/libf2c.a  
```  
  
are not removed. Looking into [`util/mksrc`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/util/mksrc#L62) suggests however, this is on purpose.  
[@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) can you confirm that?

I don't remember if there was a specific reason for not deleting the  
binaries, likely just an oversight.  If they are rebuilt as part of the  
build process then removing in a 'make src' is probably fine.  Note however  
that a host version of F2C cannot be used due to changes in the f2c.h to  
support the 64-bit port.

Sure, that is a different story.
