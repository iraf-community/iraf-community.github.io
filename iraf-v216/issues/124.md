This is required at least for the `size` and `mtime` fields (which are both defined as `char[12]`: `sprintf()` writes 12 chars, plus the closing `'\0'`, which would give 13 chars into fields with the length of 12. To avoid this, we limit the max number of chars to the field size; the `'\0'` is not needed here anyway.
