Currently, the documentation is split between the `doc/` and the `local/` subdirs, which makes it difficult to find. There is no reason why the licensing stuff is f.e. in `local`, or why `notes.v215` is in `doc/`, but `notes.v216` is in `local/`.  
  
All documentation is now moved to `doc/`. Together with [#16](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/16), the `local/` subdir now contains only a template for local packages (and a tests tar, which is going to be removed with the next PR).
