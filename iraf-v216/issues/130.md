The 64-bit porting of `noao.digiphot.photcal` stopped somewhere in the middle and left the parser untouched. This PR completes it, and also fixes a bug that slided into the old adjustment:  
  
The first patch wraps the access to the `Memr` and `Memi` code blocks with `P2R` and `P2I`, where necessary (in cases the memory was allocates as SPP "structures", like `parval` or `sym`). This closes [#129](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/129) and solves the "Segmentation fault" problem in [#128](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/128), which was usually observed whenever one tried to use the 64 bit version of `fitparams`.  
  
The second patch fixes the problem that fits with more than one fit parameter failed. So, together with the first patch, it closes [#128](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/128).  
  
This patch has been [successfully tested](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/builds/337182561) on the standard Travis platforms (Linux/macos; 32/64 bit; old/current), but also on 32/64 bit Scientific Linux 6, which is close to the ancient Redhat version NOAO uses as standard platform. A [simple test case](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/8d821857707c84bbc05ec7fb1c38997947f202d1/test/noao.digiphot.photcal.md) was added to the CI pull request [#36](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/36).
