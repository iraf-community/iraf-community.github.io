There was a `goto` slipped in the creation of the library file name that caused source and target pointer in the next `strcpy()` to be equal, which leads to a segfault on MacOS. The label `again:` is kept, since there is another goto in the code.  
  
This closes [#52](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/52) and finally [enables building on macintel](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/235581606). Yea!
