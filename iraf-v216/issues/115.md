Curl is available on MacOS as well as on Linux, and it is already used in IRAF. And its sources are currently in IRAF.  
  
In contrast, pkgget used `/usr/bin/ftp` on MacOS, which was removed in 10.13 (High Sierra). Instead of distributing a binary "ftp" executable for those systems, this simple patch replaces it with `curl` on all systems.  
  
Fixes: [#114](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/114).
