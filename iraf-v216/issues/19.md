This an alternative to [#18](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/18): if the contents of `local/iraf_test.tar.gz` are meant to be (the start of) a common tests repository, it should be unpacked and get its own subdirectory. In that case, the subdir should be later however accompanied with some documentation how to use it.  
  
This PR is done mainly for completeness; I would prefer not to have a directory (or a tarball) filled just with magic numbers and fits files. This could be kept locally until it is usable for someone else than the author of the tarball.
