On linux (32 bit), many command, like `imcopy` fail with an out-of-memory warning:  
```  
cl> imcopy dev$pix image.short  
dev$pix -> image.short  
ERROR: Out of memory  
```  
or  
```  
cl> imhead dev$pix long+  
dev$pix: Out of memory  
```  
This is a version built from source, with [#60](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/60) as the latest patch. linux64 build [succeeds](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/232477413) from the same source.

Update from the debugging of [`unix/os/zmaloc.c`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmaloc.c): allocations with less then ~2^17 bytes succeed:  
`ZMALOC(buf, 68082, stat)` gives `bufptr=0x57d50730`, `*buf=2bea8398`, `stat=0`.  
However, with more than 2^17 bytes, the system is going to return addresses in a different space:  
`ZMALOC(buf, 132946, stat)` gives `bufptr=0xf7538008`, `*buf=fba9c004`, `stat=-1`.  
  
The conversion address --> buf, [`ADDR_TO_LOC`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/hlib/libc/kernel.h#L51) just rightshifts the address. The leftmost byte is kept here. So, the [final comparison](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmaloc.c#L30-L33)  
```  
            if (*buf > 0)  
                *status = XOK;  
            else  
                *status = XERR;  
```  
seems to be wrong and should be replaced by a `*buf != 0`.  
  
__Update__: when the address is freed, the first step is that it is [checked whether the pointer is negative](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/nmemio/mfree.x#L29). And then, there are some more consistency checks that will fail with negative values. So, if we don't want to disable them, we need to make sure the address is not negative (by resetting the MSB in the address).

Maybe you still didn't understand this bug: The cause of the "out of memory" failures is the following [piece of code](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/master/unix/hlib/libc/kernel.h#L51) which has an implementation dependent behaviour according to the C standard:  
```  
#define	ADDR_TO_LOC(addr) (((XINT)((XCHAR *)(addr)))>>(sizeof(XCHAR)-1))  
```  
This code is used in [`zmaloc.c`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmaloc.c#L29) to convert a pointer (returned from [`malloc()`](http://manpages.org/malloc/3))  to an integer that can later be used as an index for the `mem` common blocks.  
  
The pointer returned from `malloc()` may have _any_ integer value: whether the most significant bit is set or not is decided internally by the memory allocation strategy. If the most significant bit is set, this pointer is then converted to a negative signed integer within the `#define` statement shown above. This signed integer is then right-shifted by one ([`sizeof(XCHAR)` is 2](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/hlib/libc/spp.h#L77)).  
  
When a signed integer with a negative value is right shifted, the C standard makes it implementation depending whether a zero is shifted in (which would make the result positive), or a one (which would keep the result negative):  
  
_ISO/IEC 9899/1999, §6.5.8_:  
> 5. The result of `E1 >> E2` is `E1` right-shifted `E2` bit positions. If `E1` has an unsigned type or if `E1` has a signed type and a nonnegative value, the value of the result is the integral part of the quotient of `E1 / 2^E2`. If `E1` has a signed type and a negative value, the resulting value is implementation-defined.  
  
In that case, the C compiler has the (implementation defined) freedom what to do. gcc keeps the sign, and then returns a negative value (which is then [returned as an error by `ZMALOC`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmaloc.c#L33)).  
  
The solution (#62) is [simple](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/pull/62/files#diff-2745ad678809be0d82cb725b88a6df2f): we need to convert the pointer to an unsigned type instead of a signed one:  
```  
#define	ADDR_TO_LOC(addr) (((unsigned XINT)((XCHAR *)(addr)))>>(sizeof(XCHAR)-1))  
```  
For unsigned values, the right shift is defined to shift in a zero. This obviously works well independently what the compiler does for signed values. And the left shift does not have these problems; here the behaviour is well-defined. On error, `malloc()` returnes `NULL`, which is [catched by `ZMALOC`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmaloc.c#L35) and not a problem for the conversion at all.  
  
The [release notes of 2.12](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/doc/notes.v212#L1065-L1075) describe basically the same problem:  
  
>  __`unix/hlib/cl.csh`__ `[pcix]`  
> Last-minute testing under RHEL showed a segfault in nearly all tasks.  This was traced to a number of pointer values being returned by the system at addresses outside of the process stack space. This also affects Fedora systems and may well become a problem for other distributions using newer kernels.  Until this is better understood, added a `limit stacksize unlimited` call to the `cl.csh` startup script as a workaround for processes started from the CL. This is still an issue for IMFORT tasks and will require the user to do the same in their `.cshrc` file, however it should be a (mostly) harmless change for most users.  _(2/5/04, MJF)_  
  
The only thing the patch [#62](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/62) does is to ensure that a zero is shifted in, and this works on all systems.
