A zero date is a valid (and not anymore unplausible) entry in an library archive. Archives with that entries can f.e. created with newer GNU ar and the `D` option, or when the `--enable-deterministic-archives` option was set during the build of ar (which is the case on modern Fedora an Debian distributions).  
  
This closes [#64](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/64) or at least is a workaround: in case the entry is zero, we will take the last modification date of the library instead.  
  
Another way would be to use the `U` option of modern GNU ar. However, since this option is not standard (and not present on older ar), this has the disadvantage that it will not work for older Linux distributions; so this PR is a compromise. Again, the opinion of [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) is needed here.
