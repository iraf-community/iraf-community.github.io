When compiling, many linking steps try to link to `libVO.a`, which fails because this library is never built.

I'm glad you are making this a separate issue so it can be tracked. [@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele) and I believe others have tripped into the problem. The response from [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) was:  
  
A "make sysgen" is still the target build-from-source command but there are known bootstrapping issues (mostly with the vendor dir and libVO.a) still to be addressed. If you don't want to wade through these right away, installing the binaries will allow you to recompile any other source changes for testing.  
  
It does seem like wading it this and solving why the build system doesn't build libVO.a should be addressed now and resolved.  
  
If Zach or I get a fix for this not building we will submit a PR with that change only.  
  
Maybe when this reaches another time zone, [@joequant](https://github.com/joequant) will be able to weight in as well.  
  
As it turns out, the build.sh in https://github.com/steelewool/iraf-v216/tree/joequant%23proposed-updates does build libVO.a.

Moving part of the discussion from [#25](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/25):  
  
> If the current build problems are a blocker for you guys, I can guarantee  
it won't get easier when you actually get to the hard stuff.  
  
I am quite sure that we can solve all these problems with your excellent help. And since there are actually source-only builds (for Mageia, Fedora, conda, Astroconda), there is some hope. We just need to get it into the proper format.  
  
BTW, since you address "you guys": we are not a dedicated group of people which are on one side of the river, while you are on the other. We (including you) are individual people who want to do something with IRAF, everyone with a slightly different focus. The idea is to do that together, so that the code does not fork. We all (including you) will benefit from that.  
  
So, if you think that the missing `libVO.a` is simple to solve, just commit a fix, or tell how to fix it. I will then again prepare a pull request (which you could then merge in turn). Otherwise I will try to write my own and discuss it here.

FYI, the approach that I took was to do a two-step build.  The first build  
compiles the system without libVO.a, uses this system to bootstrap libVO.a  
and does a second compile with libVO.a.  The fact that this requires a  
recursive build with weird dependencies is why I had to create a build  
script rather than use Makefiles, since a two step build confuses make.  
The problem with a two step approach is that since the script doesn't  
handle dependencies well, it doesn't stop the build when something bad  
happens.  I think I had to put in a special compile flag that removes the  
libVO.a dependency for the first build.  
  
The important thing with a source-only build is to know that it can be  
done.  Once it's known that it can be done, then everything else is details.

@joequant also created a new rule in his vendor/voclient Makefile (mylib) that comments out the line: cd common; ${MAKE}. I was wondering if Joseph could describe why that was necessary. Any other comments about the changes required to build libVO.a would help me out and I'm sure [@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele) as well. Or maybe [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) could provide a fix.

This seem relevant from the spool file. Without libVO.a and libcfitsio.a I can't build the x_stdgraph.x. Any thoughts on how to get the build to make libVO.a?
