On MacOS X 64 bit, I get the following error:  
```  
xc -Nz x_system.o libpkg.a -o xx_system.e  
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:  
  "_bitupk_", referenced from:  
      _dirpfa_ in libpkg.a(directory.o)  
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64  
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)  
Warning, mkpkg line 7: module `relink' not found or returned error

This is probably due to [#42](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/42), since `BITUPK` is defined the same source file as there.

Fixed in [#74](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/74)
