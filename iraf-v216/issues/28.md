When building from source, I get a number of errors like  
```  
xc -c -w -/g -/m64 [...] aclrc.c [...]  
[...]  
aclrc.c:6:18: fatal error: iraf.h: No such file or directory  
 #include <iraf.h>  
                  ^  
compilation terminated.  
```

Could this in fact be related to the mkpkg.inc file I found that defines *FLAG values? [@joequant](https://github.com/joequant) [@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele)  
  
Also, are you attempting to build for the 'linux64' target?

Could [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) elaborate on the "No". My idea was just a guess - but if you 'know' the fix could you share? [@zcsteele](https://github.com/zcsteele) and I are having similar problems and would like to know the fix that could then be pulled into the iraf-v216 master. I'm sure others would like to know the fix as well.

This problem is fixed by [#29](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/29); at least if [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) merges it.
