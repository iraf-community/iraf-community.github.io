X11IRAF is distributed as extra package and has its own version numbering.  And it is unmaintained since >10 years and runs on 32 bit only. So, it makes no sense to have it in the IRAF repo; it should have its own repo outside.  
  
This closes [#66](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/66). It also closes [#48](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/48), since X11IRAF problems should then be reported on that subdir.
