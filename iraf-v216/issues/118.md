When using xterm, the number of lines is not correctly recognized, which makes the pager (f.e. for help) showing crap. On an xterm, freshly opened with 24 lines:  
  
```  
$ echo $TERM  
xterm  
$ resize  
COLUMNS=80;  
LINES=24;  
export COLUMNS LINES;  
$ cl  
[...]  
vocl> stty   
xterm ncols=80 nlines=65   
```  
Similar for columns, when the window was resized.  
  
This does not happen when the terminal is set to xgterm, but then the graphics don't work in xterm.  
  
**This happens with the binary 2.16.1 release from NOAO.** And it happens on older Linux systems, like Scientific Linux 6 (2011) or Debian Wheezy (2013) as well as on newer systems (up to Debian testing).  
And it was reported [already years ago](http://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=1467258).
