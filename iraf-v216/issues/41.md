Trying to [compile IRAF on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229664926) (see [#36](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/36)) under MacOS 64 bit fails because `zsvjmp.s` does not assemble:  
```  
++sh -x setarch.sh  
++ls -d as  
+'[' as = as ']'  
+rm -rf as  
+ln -s as.macintel as  
[...]  
for i in zsvjmp  
+gcc -c -I/Users/travis/.iraf/ -O -DMACOSX -DMACINTEL -DMACH64 -Wall -Wunused -m64 -g -DNOVOS -Wall ../as/zsvjmp.s -o zsvjmp.o  
../as/zsvjmp.s:61:2: error: unknown directive  
 .abs _mem_, 0  
 ^  
```  
See the build log [here](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229664926#L187-L190). I am wondering how the binary distribution was compiled, since this is obviously not connected to a preinstalled binary version of IRAF.

Not sure what file you're building, but it works for me and the zsvjmp.s  
only has 46 lines:

I follow the installation advise:  
```  
IRAFARCH=`./vendor/voclient/getarch`  
mkdir build_tmp  
./install -v --term xterm --bindir `pwd`/build_tmp/bin --cache `pwd`/build_tmp/cache --imdir `pwd`/build_tmp/imdir --root `pwd` < /dev/null || true  
make ${IRAFARCH}  
make sysgen  
```  
This is documented in the Travis CI script [here](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/d6b4e21e02b035baaabf456415634cbb97e7ac02/.travis.yml#L14-L18).  
And when looking into the [GNU Assembler manual](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/), I don't find a `.abs` directive, which is in the mentioned code. [Here is](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229865246#L32-L37)  
```  
$ gcc --version  
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1

before_script.1  
```  
It seems that you are using the Apple assembler, while I (resp. Travis) uses the Gnu one.  
  
I have no idea why the line number is wrong; it comes out so of the build process. The file is [unchanged from the original one](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9e454f1e3d73c3177daf58a39d70009a3e2cb898/unix/as.macintel/zsvjmp.s) when the code is checked out.

The .abs instruction should be commented out, apparently wasn't on the copy  
I used in the first commit.  Fixed now.  The mem common address is now set  
with a --defsym,mem_=0 flag set in xc.c

Why don't you push those changes to github?  
~~For this change, will you do this or shall I write a pull request for it?~~  
__Edit__ I just saw your commit. Thanks. So, this is fixed by [783cde15](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/783cde1597b9d81474518a5921d1b61331ab8ac1)

I can confirm that this is fixed; see https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229881119
