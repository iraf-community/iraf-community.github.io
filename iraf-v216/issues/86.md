**[olebole](https://github.com/olebole)** commented on 2017-06-08

This PR is used as a proof that the current structure is portable. While the ports are not complete (no documentation, minimal testing), they show we didn't use flexibility whiloe cleaning up.  
  
List of ports:  
  
- [x] FreeBSD 64 bit, `freebsd64`  
- [x] GNU Hurd 32 bit, 'hurd`  
- [ ] MacOSX PowerPC, `macppc`  
- [ ] Linux arm, `linuxarm`  
- [ ] Linux s390x, `linuxs390x`
