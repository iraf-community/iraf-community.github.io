This allows cross compilation on a 64-bit Linux system with 32-bit Linux as target system. One advantage is that one doesn't need an 32-bit system to build the 32-bit version (just like for MacOS X). The other advantage is that -- if used in conjunction with [#36](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/36) -- we get regular tests for 32-bit Linux versions on Travis.  
  
This requires to have according compiler support and libraries installed (`gcc-multilib`,  `libcurl4-gnutls-dev:i386`, `libncurses5-dev:i386` on Debian/Ubuntu).  
  
This PR closes [#72](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/72).  
  
The PR needs to be manually rebased once the other patches are applied -- specifically `use-sh-in-mklibs` (#38). But this is a rather simple change...
