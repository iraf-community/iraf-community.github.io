One of the tests in the test procedure is [Coordinate systems within IRAF](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/add-travis-ci/test/testproc.md#coordinate-systems-within-iraf). This however shows some inconsistencies:  
  
When running with the binary (linux64) version, or the version compiled on [Ubuntu 12.04](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/233966822) one gets the expected output:  
  
```  
cl> listpix dev$wpix[16:20,5:6] wcs=world format="%H %h"  
13:28:05.1 47:24:01.4  41.  
13:28:05.1 47:24:01.4  38.  
13:28:05.0 47:24:01.4  41.  
13:28:04.9 47:24:01.4  42.  
13:28:04.8 47:24:01.4  40.  
13:28:05.1 47:24:02.1  38.  
13:28:05.1 47:24:02.2  38.  
13:28:05.0 47:24:02.2  38.  
13:28:04.9 47:24:02.2  39.  
13:28:04.8 47:24:02.2  38.  
```  
  
These numbers are also obtained with versions compiled on Debian Squeeze and Wheezy (gcc 4.7.2), and they are verified by using wcslib.  
  
When running on a version compiled (exactly the same source, same environment, with exactly the same settings) on [Ubuntu 14.04](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/233966821), the output is different:  
  
```  
cl> listpix dev$wpix[16:20,5:6] wcs=world format="%H %h"  
Warning: setting CD2_2 to 1.  
13:27:50.0 -29:49:49.8  41.  
13:27:50.0 -29:49:49.8  38.

13:27:50.0 -29:46:54.7  38.

13:27:50.0 -29:46:54.7  38.  
```  
  
This is clearly wrong, and looks like another problem with newer gcc. The same problem is on Debian Jessie (gcc-4.9.2) and Stretch (both 32 and 64 bit tested).

For reference: the problem appears in [`sys/mwcs/iwewcs.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/mwcs/iwewcs.x#L248-L249). The `max()` calculation is done only once for the first array member (which is zero in the second row of a diagonal matrix):  
```  
	    do j = 1, ndim  
		maxval = max (maxval, abs(IW_CD(iw,i,j)))  
```  
This happens for gcc version 4.8 and later; clang (MacOS) seems not to be affected. Cause is that `IW_CD` will be translated into the `Mem` common block, and this was wrongly declared to have only one member, which allows such an optimization (fixed now in [e5f8b2cf](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/commit/e5f8b2cfe5d875d4eaea07de807b40c0bbdb6795)).
