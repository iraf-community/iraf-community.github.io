Add `libc/libc.h` to the list of files which need to be patched for a new IRAF root as [recommended by [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf)](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/issues/3#issuecomment-298389713). This shall fix [#7](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/7).  
  
There are however a number of other files that still have `/iraf/iraf`:  
  
* `unix/bin.linux64/f2c.h`  
  `unix/bin.linux/f2c.h`  
  `unix/bin.macintel/f2c.h`  
   Other `f2c.h` (there are 10 of them!!!) don't have this however, even in `unix/bin.*`  
   If this `f2c.h` is used ever it will fail.  
```  
#include "/iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/libc/kproto.h"  
#include "/iraf/iraf/unix/hlib/libc/vosproto.h"  
```  
  
* `unix/boot/xyacc/dextern.h`  
   used in `unix/boot/xyacc/y2.c` as `char *parser = PARSER;`  
   as default parser (may be overwritten on cmd line).  
  This is handled in [#84](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/84).  
```  
#define	PARSER "/iraf/iraf/lib/yaccpar.x"  
```  
  
* `unix/boot/spp/xc.c`  
   `NEED_GCC_SPECS` is however never defined, so we can ignore this?  
```  
#ifdef NEED_GCC_SPECS  
 ...  
arglist[nargs++] = "/iraf/iraf/unix/bin/gcc-specs";  
```  
  
* `vendor/x11iraf/ximtool/raster.c`  
  `vendor/x11iraf/vximtool/vximtool.c`  
   This is x11iraf, which is not the scope in the moment... See also [#70](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/70).  
```  
static char *fb_paths[] = { ... "/iraf/iraf/dev/imtoolrc",  
```
