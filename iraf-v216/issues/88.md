`IRAF_MAIN` is an SPP procedure in [`sys/etc/main.x`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/sys/etc/main.x#L126-L139). Some of its arguments are `int`:  
  
```  
int procedure iraf_main (a_cmd, a_inchan, a_outchan, a_errchan,  
	a_driver, a_devtype, prtype, bkgfile, jobcode, sys_runtask, onentry)  
  
char	a_cmd[ARB]		# command to be executed or null string  
int	a_inchan		# process standard input  
int	a_outchan		# process standard output  
int	a_errchan		# process standard error output  
int	a_driver		# ZLOCPR address of device driver  
int	a_devtype		# device type (text or binary)  
int	prtype			# process type (connected, detached, host)  
char	bkgfile[ARB]		# packed filename of bkg file if detached  
int	jobcode			# jobcode if detached process  
extern	sys_runtask()		# client task execution procedure  
extern	onentry()		# client onentry procedure  
```  
  
This translates into `XINT *` as the required argument type in C ([and not `int *`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmain.c#L30-L32)) when [called ](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zmain.c#L192-L193)in `sys/os/zmain.c`. Depending on memory structure and endianess (the problem appeared at IBM z Systems, a big endian system), this will give wrong values for the argument.
