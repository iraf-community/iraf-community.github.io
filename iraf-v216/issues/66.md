X11IRAF is outdated, not build by default when compiling IRAF,  available only for a subset of architectures, and has its own development history (it is mainly unchanges since 10 years).  
  
IMO its development (if there is any) should be done in a separate directory, significantly reducing the size and complexity of the main IRAF repository.

Is there any plan to move x11iraf to its own git repository. If there is one I couldn't find it.

There are no plans to further develop (or replace) the X11IRAF tools.  Users are free to create their own repo for development if they choose.
