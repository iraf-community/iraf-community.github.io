The `mklibs`, `mkclean` and `getarch` scripts in the different vendor subdirs are still `/bin/csh`, which would require the installation of the C-shell to build IRAF.  
  
This patch converts them all to `bin/sh`.  
  
I tested them locally, and all but `vendor/mkpkg` work well for me. The one person in the world who is able to run a complete build on an unchanged IRAF source tree is hereby asked to test if the build works as well within the IRAF build, and then to merge.
