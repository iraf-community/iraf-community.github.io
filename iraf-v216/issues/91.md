The main reason for this is that an uninitialized global constant by default [does not cause linking of the object file by itself](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44343859/symbol-not-found-when-static-linking-on-macosx) on MacOSX, for example in [this build log](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/244167280#L2400-L2405).  
  
The side effect is that this patch ensures `oscwd` is initialized before it is [used by `ZFGCWD`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/os/zfgcwd.c#L36).
