The README file references this build as 2.16.1. Does anyone know if that is correct? If it is correct should the repository be renamed to 'iraf-v2161'?

  The repo contains the frozen IRAF v2.16.1 distribution plus any changes  
made on our development servers since that release, so technically it is  
'v2.16.2DEV'.  The "v216" name is meant to refer to all v2.16 releases  
where a future v2.16.2 release would create a new branch for the version.  
I can confirm the various README docs, motd file etc have not had the  
version number updated, but you'll find code that post-dates the  
v2.16.1EXPORT release date.
