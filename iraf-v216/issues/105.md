Negative pointers may appear when the address of the `Mem` common  block is larger than the handled address. Usually, the address of the `Mem` common block is set to zero in `zsvjmp.s`. However, this is not always the case; f.e. currently this is disabled on the linux64 platform. The big problem for the future here is however the introduction of [Position Independent Executables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code#PIE), which make such a setting impossible by design.  
  
The sign of the pointers was used as a flag to mark a freed space, so that a second attempt to free it will be discovered and properly handled. The sign was also used as a marker in the garbage collector to re-use positions that are already freed.   
  
This PR uses in both cases NULL as the marker.  
The `nmemio` module was checked carefully for other sign dependent behaviour of the pointer. The garbage collector code is however unused in the moment.  
  
This fixes [#103](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/103).   
As always, it is tested against new and old compilers, MacOS and Linux, 32 and 64 bit, with and without PIE.
