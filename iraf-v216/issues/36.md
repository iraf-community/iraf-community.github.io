Since you ([@iraf](https://github.com/iraf)) want to have checks that a pull request does not break anything: here is the setup for testing with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).  
  
To enable this, you need to login to travis-ci, enable this repository and then merge the pull request. After that, any new PR is automatically tested, which may in future help you checking whether a PR is OK.  
  
The tests are currently executed for Linux (64 bit, Ubuntu 14.04) and OS X (64 bit, 10.11.6).  
They obviously fail in the moment since the IRAF build is buggy -- see the various bugs and pull requests. Having this in the master tree however enables yourself to see what the next problem is. As an example, [here](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229064187) is the run on Linux, and [here](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/jobs/229064188) the one on OS X. BTW, currently it fails because of [#7](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/7), which is fixed in [#22](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/22). If you first merge the current PR and then [#22](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/22), you will see the progress :-)  
  
Once we can build IRAF from source, this gives a powerful instrument to monitor the changes. We can then also add other systems (Ubuntu 12.04, other OS X versions). 32-bit systems are not that simple since the default environment is always 64 bit; however once everything compiles, we can try to find a solution there as well.  
  
This fixes [#13](https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/issues/13).
