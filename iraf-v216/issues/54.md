The cd operation inside of ecl isn't working if a blank character is in the directory name. This is not working using the 64-bit linux tar ball and not working in my steelewool fork of iris-v216 on the branch oleboleUpdates.

```
ecl> ls
Astro Images			 oec_plots-master.zip   open_exoplanet_catalogue-master
Celestron			 oec_tables-master.zip  open_exoplanet_catalogue-master.zip
NexRemoteInstall_1_7_22.zip  oec_web-master.zip

ecl> cd Astro Images/
ERROR: Cannot change directory to `Astro'
	 called as: `cd (Astro, Images/)'

ecl> cd "Astro Images"
ERROR: Cannot change directory to `Astro Images'
	 called as: `cd (Astro Images)'

ecl> cd Astro\ Images
ERROR: Cannot change directory to `Astro\ Images'
	 called as: `cd (Astro\ Images)'
```

Just FYI I made a 2nd virtual machine for testing the V 2.16.1 outside of the software that is being built from the software on github. But this example fails in very much the same way on both.

Spaces have never been supported in path names.

Thanks for the info. It did not occur to me that blanks wouldn't be supported - my directories are full of them.

On my linux system I did just use softlinks to reference my directories which have blanks in them and that worked just find. But, since every OS at there now allows blanks in directory and file names it seems IRAF should come along.

Then submit a PR, but if it was a trivial change it would have been done
already.  The filename mapping is done mostly in fio and the kernel code.

I did not mean to imply the change was trivial - but one I thought would be useful. I have not idea how complicated the change might be. I've got this listed as an issue and after I get a fix in place will indeed to a pull request after I get a fix in place.
