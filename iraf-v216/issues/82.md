This is the implementation of an [idea from a few years ago](https://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=1468323&mode=&show=30#1468416), where [@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) (after some discussion) [agreed that this may work](https://iraf.net/forum/viewtopic.php?showtopic=1468323&mode=&show=30&page=2#1468424).
  
This completely removes the need of patching the sources before compilation (so, no need for `./install` as first step), and basically makes the package relocatable. There is still the need to patch some scripts before installation of the binary package (`$iraf` environment variable in `cl.sh` & friends), however -- but this is for convenience only. Setting `$iraf` is already enough for most tasks.
