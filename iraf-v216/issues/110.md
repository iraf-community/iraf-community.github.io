f2c does not recognize the length of a variable `FMT` string and will try to read the string until a non-blank appears. For example, the [FORTRAN statement](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/pkg/tbtables/fitsio/ftc2dd.f#L30)   
  
```Fortran  
      READ (cval, FMT=iform, ERR=900) val  
```  
translates with f2c to:  
  
```C  
    ici__1.icierr = 1;  
    ici__1.iciend = 0;  
    ici__1.icirnum = 1;  
    ici__1.icirlen = cval_len; // <-- length of cval  
    ici__1.iciunit = cval;  
    ici__1.icifmt = iform;     // <-- NO length of iform!  
    i__1 = s_rsfi(&ici__1);  
// [...]  
```  
  
The format strings are [declared as `CHARACTER*8`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/pkg/tbtables/fitsio/ftc2dd.f#L13) and do not automatically have a `\0` appended at the end when they are created. Therefore, when the string is filled with blanks until the end, it will read one char over the end, which is hopefully a non-blank, but also may lead to a segmentation fault. Specifically this happens [in `unix/f2c/libf2c/fmt.c`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/f2c/libf2c/fmt.c#L113):  
  
```C  
#define skip(s) while(*s==' ') s++  
// [...]  
 static  
#ifdef KR_headers  
char *f_s(s,curloc) char *s;#  
else  
const char *f_s(const char *s, int curloc)  
#endif  
{  
	skip(s);  
	if(*s++!='(')  
	{  
		return(NULL);  
	}  
	if(f__parenlvl++ ==1) f__revloc=curloc;  
	if(op_gen(RET1,curloc,0,0)<0 ||  
		(s=f_list(s))==NULL)  
	{  
		return(NULL);  
	}  
	skip(s); // <------------- here  
	return(s);  
}  
```  
  
This is probably a bug in f2c; however it is also not fixed in the recent versions as well. To work around this, this PR adds a trailing `\0` to the strings used in a `FMT` statement to mark their end. The maximum length of the generated `FMT` strings was 7 ([in `ftc2dd.f`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/pkg/tbtables/fitsio/ftc2dd.f#L27)), so adding one character will not exceed the declared length.  
  
This is the same as when using the `FORMAT` statement, where also a null terminated string is used:   
  
```Fortran  
1000  FORMAT(I5)  
```  
  
translates to a simple null terminated C string:  
  
```C  
    /* Format strings */  
    static char fmt_1000[] = "(i5)";  
```  
  
As always, this pull request is [successfully tested](https://travis-ci.org/olebole/iraf-v216/builds/293156214), with new and old compilers, with Linux and MacOSX, with 32 and 64 bit.
