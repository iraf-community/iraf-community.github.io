If on linux64 the system's own curl development libraries are not installed (f.e. libcurl4-openss-dev), the compilation fails when trying to build `vendor/voclient/libsamp/libxrpc/xmlrpc-c-1.16.29/`, mentioning that curl was not found:  
```  
[...]  
checking for _stricmp... no  
checking whether to use Abyss pthread function... yes  
checking for curl-xmlrpc-config... no  
checking for curl-config... configure: error: cURL not found; see './configure --help'  
no  
GNUmakefile:1: srcdir.mk: No such file or directory  
GNUmakefile:9: /home/oles/Projects/2015/upstream/iraf/iraf-v216/vendor/voclient/libsamp/libxrpc/xmlrpc-c-1.16.29/config.mk: No such file or directory  
GNUmakefile:39: /common.mk: No such file or directory  
=======================================  
= You must run Configure before Make. =  
=======================================  
false  
[...]  
```  
On MacOSX, the build procedure requires a system curl anyway.   
Since curl is readily available on all Linux distributions, it is now the question whether we should use the convenience copy of curl at all (and to fix the install script by providing the required paths to `libxmlrpc`), or if we remove the whole curl from the archive and depend on the external one (as on MacOSX).  
[@iraf](https://github.com/iraf) any opinions here?
