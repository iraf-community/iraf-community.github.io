When `strcpy()` is called with overlapping (or identical) addresses, the behaviour is [undefined](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strcpy). Since this happens in [one place](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/mkpkg/tok.c#L831) when calling `getcmd()`, we have to check before [`strcpy()`](https://github.com/iraf-community/iraf/blob/9590f45760a4791f3305407fb51c87f1282b32be/unix/boot/mkpkg/tok.c#L1196) for this case.
